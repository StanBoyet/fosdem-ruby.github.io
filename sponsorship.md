If you'd like to help the Ruby devroom to welcome speakers from all around the
world, you can participate and support one of most important European community
event.

Considering that [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is a free and non-commercial event
organized by the community for the community, it is strongly committed to
not becoming "yet another trade-show" inundating attendees with advertising.

For that reason, you decide how much money you want to give and we can offer you
the following: a desk to put your swags, a mention of your support into opening
and closing slides, a tweeted thank from the organizer, and the opportunity to
support a community event.

We'll use the money to cover the following (ordered by priority):
speakers' accommodations, speakers' travels, a dinner, and running cost.
