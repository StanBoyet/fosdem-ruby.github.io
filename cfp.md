# 2016

## Intro

The Ruby Devroom at FOSDEM is an interpreter and runtime focused developer room for the Ruby programming language. Its goal is to host technical content focused around the Ruby
language and the numerous open source projects and initiatives which implement,
extend and instrument the Ruby language.

The time format for presentations in the Ruby devroom is not set in stone, but
the ideal duration is around 35-45 minutes with Q&A included.

We are open to suggestions for panels and/or more open, moderated, discussions
provided the topics proposed fit with the theme of the room.

### Talks/topics we'd like to see

Some suggestions on the kinds of topics we would like to see discussed in the
Ruby devroom:

* The current state of the Ruby language itself
* Presentations on the techniques employed by various Ruby virtual machines and
  interpreters, along with the effectiveness and/or trade-offs of implementing
  those techniques
* Upcoming Ruby language features, and the implementation challenges and/or
  user benefits that they provide
* Tools and practices used to certify Ruby language conformity and evaluate its
  performance
* Costs and Opportunities provided by the multitude of implementations
* Ways to extend the language (natively or not)
